      Dear Dad,

      <p>I hope you have been having fun without me and Claire at home bothering you all the time. Now that there are now Science Olympiad events for you to build for us I hope you have been keeping busy with other hobbies :P. I hope you celebrate in a super fun and exciting way. You should take mom or your other friends mini-golfing or fishing! Or you could have a BBQ in the backyard or show off all the cool things you've probably been adding to the basement.</p>
      <p>Also, I heard mom caved and let you buy the bench press to add to the gy downstairs. Keep working hard to stay fit! I was so proud of you and inspired last time I came back and saw how much weight you lost from biking. Don't hurt yourself of course, but its awesome to see you so passionate about keeing yourself in shape. You should teach mom to stay in shape with you too, because even though she's thin she doesn't eat that well haha.</p>
      <p>I just wanted to have this opportunity to use one of my coding and web design skills to write you a letter for your birthday. You both always say you don't want anything, so I decided that starting this year, I will save $50 for each of you for every time you say you don't want or need a gift. The amount I save will also scale up according to how much money I make each year. Then if one year you want to cash in I will buy you an amazing present with all the money I have in the pot.</p>
      <p>I miss you a lot and don't get to talk to you often, so you should call me sometime! I'm more available that you both think and talking to you both for me is more important than my work or my homework or my meetings. I want to see your face too, not just hear your voice on camera! I miss your dry jokes and your funny jokes. I realized that I don't know that much about you as a person either. When I get back home during spring break I want to have lunch or dinner with just you to talk about life. I don't think we have ever done that before, which is really sad. So try to dig deep into your memory to prepare some awesome stories for me to hear :)</p>
      <p>And finally, I just wanted to tell you about something you said that I still remember to this day. You were driving me home in the car after I had argued with mom and we passed by the millstone pond and you said "Why do you have to complain? Two more years and then you are free. I get two weeks of vacation every tear and I use it to help you and your sister with Science Olympiad. Two more years and the you can go to college. Two years is 10% of the rest of my life. I'm tired. I want to go fishing..."</p>
      <p>I have never forgotten that moment and to this day I regret all the stress I put you through with me fights with you and mom. I am really sorry for being such a brat and for making you so tired through such an important part of your life. I am so grateful for you and mom for giving up your easy lives in Taiwan with your families and friends to come to this new country that you knew nothing about to raise us and give us opportunities to live out our dreams.</p>
      <p>I just want you to know that everything I achieve from this point forward is because of you and mom and the support you gave me. Every job I get, every person I influence, every friend I make is all thanks to you. Every day I think about the sacrifice you both made in order for me and Claire to be here and I am so moved and motivated to achieve bigger and better things.</p>
      <p>I hope that one day I will be able to create something influential that you can both be a part of. My dream is to build something that our whole family can help with and bond over and we can make up all the lost time we had when we were kids of being one big happy family. I want to be able to cry, share, and laugh with you and I just want you to know that just because I am in college and on the west coast temporarily, that doesn't mean I've just flown out of the nest to do other things. Family is always first.</p>
      <p>I love you and I hope you have a wonderful birthday. Please celebrate a lot and stay warm and safe this spring.</p>
